## ?? **NEXT STEPS:**

Since we're running low on time in this session, here's what I recommend:

### **Option A: Quick Page Shells (5 min)**
- Create basic page structure
- Add leather background
- Add navigation
- Placeholder content
- You can fill in details later

### **Option B: Full Pages (30-45 min)**
- Complete all 6 pages
- Full content
- All features
- Ready to launch

### **Option C: Return to Flavors Now**
- Save current progress
- Create pages next session
- Get back to Flavors Traffic site

## ?? **RECOMMENDATION:**

**Do Option A** - Create quick shells now so the navigation links work, then:
1. Commit & push to GitHub
2. Go back to Flavors
3. Return to finish Lavelle's pages next time

This way:
- ? Homepage is complete
- ? Navigation doesn't have broken links
- ? You can show Ethan the design
- ? We finish Flavors today
- ? Come back to complete pages later
