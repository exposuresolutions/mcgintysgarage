# ?? Lavelle's Auto - System Review & Handover

Hi Ethan,

We have upgraded your digital presence from a simple website to a **fully integrated Garage Management System**. This isn't just about looking good; it's about automating the boring stuff so you can focus on fixing cars.

## ??? What We Built

### 1. The New Website (`index.html`)
*   **Modern Design**: Clean, professional, and mobile-friendly.
*   **Service Booking**: Customers can book specific services (NCT, Diagnostics, Repairs) directly.
*   **AI Chat Agent**: A 24/7 assistant that answers basic questions and directs urgent queries to your WhatsApp.
*   **Community Features**: Sections for "Cars for Sale" and "Customer Showcase" to build local engagement.

### 2. The "Brain" (GoHighLevel CRM)
The website is connected to a powerful backend system (GoHighLevel). Here is what it does for you:

*   **?? AI Receptionist**:
    *   **Missed Call Text Back**: If you miss a call, the system automatically texts the customer: *"Hi, this is Lavelle's Auto. I'm under a bonnet right now. How can I help?"*
    *   **Booking Management**: When a customer books on the site, it automatically goes into your calendar.

*   **?? Automated Reminders**:
    *   **NCT Reminders**: The system tracks when a customer's NCT is due and sends them a text 4 weeks before.
    *   **Service Reminders**: Automatically reminds customers 6 months or 1 year after their last service.

*   **?? Invoicing & Payments**:
    *   We can integrate **Stripe**. You can text an invoice link to a customer, and they pay on their phone before picking up the keys. No more chasing cash.

## ?? How to Test It

1.  **Try the Chat**: Click the chat bubble in the bottom right. Ask it about "NCT" or "Booking".
2.  **Make a Booking**: Fill out the "Book Your Service" form.
    *   *Note: Currently, this is in "Demo Mode". Once we connect your GHL API Key, these bookings will appear on your phone immediately.*
3.  **Check the Links**: Click "Call Us" or "Chat on WhatsApp" on your mobile to ensure they open the right apps.

## ?? Next Steps for You

1.  **Review the Content**: Read the "About" and "Services" sections. Is the tone right? (We went for "Honest, Skilled, Local").
2.  **Provide GHL Keys**: We need your GoHighLevel API Key to turn on the live booking connection.
3.  **Photos**: Send us real photos of the garage and your team to replace the placeholders.
